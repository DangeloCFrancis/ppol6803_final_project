## Purpose

Our research project seeks to identify the key characteristics to identify and predict how a voter votes. 
 This project utilizes a Classification and Regression Tree model, and 'glm' (logistic and probit regression) models to predict the probability that a survey respondent voted 'conservatively' or 'liberally'[^1]. The primary data for analysis and modeling will be survey data from the [American National Election Studies](https://electionstudies.org/), a collaboration between Duke University,the University of Michigan,the University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin), Stanford University, and the National Science Foundation (NSF).  

For our model, we plan on using questions that the ANES asks about a candidate that voter voted for (*e.g., "Which candidate did you vote for in...?"*) as the outcome variable our model will predict. The goal of our models are to precisely predict which a voter voted for using the responses from survey questions asking about policies, such as transgender rights, gun control, reproductive rights, etc. We will incorporate a variable importance analysis to deduce which survey topics and demographic characteristics are the best indicators of voters' candidate preference.

library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels) # use case weights

# tidying, getting years to 2000 - 2020 and pre-election vs post-election

# Question for Aaron and Mia: are we able to use only updated variables (~70) plus key ones (such as race indicators) to do modeling, or would that be detrimental to our model?

# Answer: we can drop most variables - use SME to determine what is needed

# Question: some variables don't have a value in election years...

# VCF9999 Version Number Of Release Weight post-election weight full sample - is it ok to drop obs with missing weight?

# VCF0705,VCF0706: outcome variables - REMOVE before testing

# VCF0736:  vote for US House - should possibly keep to capture effect of ballot splitting 

# VCF0824: has skip pattern if responded "moderate" to VCF0849, need to address

# VCF0900, VCF0901b: possibly remove? 

# need to filter for voters (get rid of nonvoter observations)


# Keep VCF0004 (year), VCF9999 (post election weight), VCF0013 and VCF0014 (post and pre election completion indicator), and VCF0748 (voted on election day or not)

# Double check thermometers and : selections
